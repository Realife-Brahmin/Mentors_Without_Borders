# Mentors Without Borders: Julia Programming

Welcome to the **Mentors_Without_Borders** GitHub repository, a collaborative space where my students and I come together to dive into the world of programming with Julia, guided by the exercises and teachings from *Think Julia* by Ben Lawens.

## About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to Julia programming exercises primarily based on the free text-book *[Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html)* by Ben Lawens. It serves as an interactive platform for both students and mentors to contribute solutions, share insights, and explore the vast capabilities of Julia programming. My goal is to not only to get my students to solve exercises but also to understand the underlying principles of computer science and programming paradigms. This course was started as part of the intitiative by [Mentors Without Borders](https://www.mentorswithoutborders.net/) community.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Julia (latest version recommended). Visit [the official Julia website](https://julialang.org/downloads/) for installation instructions.
- A text editor or an IDE that supports Julia (e.g., [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the Julia extension).
 
Students who wish to be a part of the free course may [email](mailto:aryan.r.jha@gmail.com) me for the Slack Channel link.

## How does the course work?
- The course is almost entirely done asynchronously. While there is a weekly contact hour (Saturday 12 Noon Pacific Time), it is reserved for doubts in exercise problems, troubleshooting sessions, etc.
- Primary mode of continuous interaction throughout the week with me will be via Slack messaging.

## Intended Outcome of the course
- Students are confident in their programming skills and have a working knowledge of Computer Science fundamentals. Confident enough to apply to their dream tech company, or higher studies in their desired STEM degree. 

## Acknowledgements
- Ben Lawens, for the invaluable resource Think Julia that inspired this course.
- [Edmond Pruteanu](mailto:edmond@mwbtraining.net) founder of Mentors Without Borders for recruiting me as a mentor.
- Most importantly, my students, for keeping me on my toes through their inquisitiveness and inspiring me to keep learning more.
