# Mentors Without Borders: Julia Programming Exercises

Welcome to the **Mentors_Without_Borders** GitHub repository, a collaborative space where students and mentors come together to dive into the world of programming with Julia, guided by the exercises and teachings from *Think Julia* by Ben Lawens. Our mission is to foster a global community of learners who support each other in mastering Julia programming through shared knowledge and experience.

## About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to Julia programming exercises primarily based on the book *[Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html)* by Ben Lawens. It serves as an interactive platform for both students and mentors to contribute solutions, share insights, and explore the vast capabilities of Julia programming. Our goal is not only to solve exercises but also to understand the underlying principles of computer science and programming paradigms as taught by Julia.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Julia (latest version recommended). Visit [the official Julia website](https://julialang.org/downloads/) for installation instructions.
- A text editor or an IDE that supports Julia (e.g., VSCode with the Julia extension, Atom with Juno, or Jupyter Notebook).

### Installation

Clone this repository to get started with the exercises:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mentors_Without_Borders.git
cd Mentors_Without_Borders
