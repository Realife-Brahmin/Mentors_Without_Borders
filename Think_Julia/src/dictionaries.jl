    histogramViaVectors(str::String) -> Vector{Int64}

Generates a histogram of the letters in a given string, assuming a lowercase English alphabet.

# Arguments
- `str::String`: The input string from which to generate the histogram. The function is case-insensitive but only considers lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z').

# Returns
- A 26-element vector of `Int64`, where each index corresponds to a letter in the English alphabet ('a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26) and the value at each index represents the count of that letter in the input string.

# Notes
- The function converts each character in the input string to lowercase before processing to ensure case-insensitivity.
- Non-alphabetic characters are ignored, and only occurrences of English alphabetic characters are counted.
- The ASCII value of 'a' is 97. Therefore, the calculation `Int(lowercase(str[i]))-96` maps 'a' to 1, 'b' to 2, ..., 'z' to 26.

# Examples
```julia
# Generate a histogram for a simple string
histogram = histogramViaVectors("hello")

# Generate a histogram including uppercase characters
histogram = histogramViaVectors("Hello World")
```

    histogramViaDictionaries1(str::String) -> Dict{Char,Int64}

Creates a frequency histogram of the letters in a given string using a dictionary, accounting for lowercase English letters only.

# Arguments
- `str::String`: The input string from which to generate the histogram. The function processes the string case-insensitively.

# Returns
- A dictionary of type `Dict{Char,Int64}` where each key is a lowercase letter from the English alphabet, and the corresponding value is the count of that letter in the input string.

# Notes
- The function converts each character to lowercase before counting to ensure case-insensitivity.
- Non-alphabetic characters are ignored; the histogram includes only occurrences of English alphabetic characters ('a' to 'z').
- This approach allows for dynamic key insertion into the dictionary, with each key being a character from the string and its value being the occurrence count. This is useful for strings with a diverse set of characters and for efficiently handling large datasets where the exact character set might not be known in advance.

# Examples
```julia
# Create a histogram for a simple string
histogram = histogramViaDictionaries1("hello")

# Include uppercase characters in the histogram

    histogramViaDictionaries2(str::String) -> Dict{Char,Int64}

Generates a frequency histogram of letters in a given string using a dictionary. This approach is a streamlined version of the method presented in `histogramViaDictionaries1`, utilizing the `get` function for more concise code.

# Context
This function is an implementation of Exercise 11-1 in "Think Julia," where the goal is to create a histogram of characters in a string. Compared to `histogramViaDictionaries1`, this version simplifies the process of checking for the existence of a key in the dictionary and incrementing its value.

# Arguments
- `str::String`: The input string from which to generate the histogram. The function is case-insensitive, focusing solely on lowercase English letters.

# Returns
- A `Dict{Char,Int64}` where each key represents a lowercase letter found in the input string, and the corresponding value is the count of that letter.

# Notes
- Utilizes the `get` function to streamline the retrieval and incrementing of character counts, reducing the need for explicit key existence checks.
- As with the previous function, this method ensures case-insensitivity by converting all input characters to lowercase before processing.
- Non-alphabetic characters are ignored, with the histogram focusing on occurrences of English alphabetic characters ('a' to 'z').

# Examples
```julia
# Create a histogram from a simple string
histogram = histogramViaDictionaries2("hello")

# Create a histogram that includes uppercase characters

    printhist(h::Dict)

Prints the contents of a histogram (or any dictionary) to the console, displaying each key-value pair on a new line.

# Arguments
- `h::Dict`: A dictionary whose keys are characters (or potentially any type that can be converted to a string) and whose values are the counts or any associated value that can be represented as an integer or string.

# Behavior
- Iterates through each key in the dictionary, printing the key followed by its associated value on separate lines. The function assumes that both the keys and values can be meaningfully represented as strings, making it suitable for printing histograms or similar key-value data structures.

# Notes
- This function does not return a value; its sole purpose is to output the dictionary's contents to the console in a readable format.
- While designed with character histograms in mind, `printhist` is generic enough to be used with any dictionary for debugging or display purposes, provided the dictionary's contents are suitable for textual representation.

Sorts a dictionary by its keys and optionally prints the sorted dictionary or returns the sorted values. This function can directly print the sorted dictionary, return a matrix of sorted key-value pairs, or do both based on the `returnType` parameter.

# Arguments
- `h`: Dictionary to be sorted and processed.
- `returnType`: Determines the function's output behavior. Options are:

Prints the contents of either a dictionary or a matrix in a standardized two-column format. For dictionaries, it first sorts the dictionary by keys, then prints each key-value pair on a new line. For matrices, it directly prints each row assuming each row represents a key-value pair.

# Arguments
-	`a`: The input can be either a `Dict` or a `Matrix`. If a `Dict` is provided, it is first sorted using `printDictSorted` with `returnType="valuesOnly"` to convert it into a matrix format.

# Behavior
-	If `a` is a `Dict`, it is converted into a matrix where the first column represents sorted keys and the second column represents their corresponding values.

	printDictSorted2(h::Dict; returnType::String="printOnly")

Sorts a dictionary by its keys and processes it according to the specified `returnType`. This version uses `sort!` on a collected list of dictionary keys for sorting, then pairs each sorted key with its corresponding value to form a matrix. Depending on `returnType`, it can print this matrix, return it, or both.

# Arguments
- `h`: Dictionary to be sorted and processed. Keys can be of any type that is sortable.
- `returnType`: Specifies how to handle the sorted dictionary. Options include:
	- "printOnly": Only prints the sorted dictionary, does not return it.
	- "valuesOnly": Returns the sorted key-value pairs as a matrix.
	- "valuesAndPrint": Prints the sorted dictionary and returns the key-value pairs as a matrix.
	- Other values trigger an "Undefined return type." error.

# Returns
- Based on `returnType`, this function may return a 2-column matrix where the first column contains sorted keys and the second column contains their corresponding values, or it may not return anything if it only prints.

# Behavior
- Keys are collected and sorted. The sorted keys are then used to create a matrix paired with their corresponding values.
- The function demonstrates flexibility in output handling, supporting different operational modes through the `returnType` parameter.

Performs a reverse lookup by searching for all keys in the dictionary `d` that have the value `v`.

# Arguments
- `d::Dict`: The dictionary to search through. Can have keys and values of any type.
- `v`: The value to search for among the dictionary's values.

# Returns
- A vector containing all keys that match the given value `v`. If no matching keys are found, a warning is emitted, and an empty vector is returned.

# Notes
- The function iterates over all keys in the dictionary, comparing each key's associated value with `v`.
- If multiple keys have the same value `v`, all such keys are included in the returned vector.

    invertDict0(d)

Inverts a dictionary `d`, transforming it from a mapping of keys to values into a mapping of values to lists of keys. This generic version does not specify type parameters for the dictionary, making it flexible for use with dictionaries containing various types of keys and values.

# Arguments
- `d`: The original dictionary to be inverted.

# Returns
- A new dictionary where each value from the original dictionary becomes a key, and the corresponding value is a list (vector) of keys from the original dictionary that mapped to that value.

# Behavior
- Iterates over each key-value pair in the original dictionary.
- Checks if the value already exists as a key in the inverted dictionary. If not, initializes a new list (vector) with the current key. If the value does exist, appends the current key to the existing list.

Inverts a dictionary, transforming it from a mapping of keys to values into a mapping of values to lists of keys. This is useful for cases where you want to find all keys that share the same value.

# Arguments
- `d`: The original dictionary of type `Dict{Tk,Tv}` to be inverted. `Tk` represents the type of the keys, and `Tv` represents the type of the values.

# Returns
- A new dictionary of type `Dict{Tv,Vector{Tk}}` where each value from the original dictionary becomes a key in the new dictionary. The corresponding value in the new dictionary is a vector of keys from the original dictionary that mapped to that value.

# Behavior
- Iterates through each key-value pair in the original dictionary.
- For each pair, the function checks if the value already exists as a key in the inverted dictionary. If it does, the current key is appended to the list of keys for that value. If it does not, a new entry is created in the inverted dictionary with the value as the key and a vector containing the current key.
- Utilizes the `get` function to simplify the process of checking for existence and initializing vectors as needed.

Calculates the Fibonacci number for a given index `x` using memoization to optimize recursive calls. The function stores previously calculated Fibonacci numbers in `fibMemo` to avoid redundant calculations. An optional `verbose` mode can be enabled to log the function's progress.

# Arguments
- `x`: The index in the Fibonacci sequence for which the value is sought. Must be of type `Int64`.
- `fibMemo`: An optional memoization dictionary of type `Dict{Int64,Int128}` pre-initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers. Defaults to `Dict(0 => 0, 1 => 1)`.
- `verbose`: An optional boolean flag that, when set to `true`, enables detailed logging of the function's execution process.

    txt2Dict(filename::String="words.txt"; rawDataFolder::String="rawData/", extension::String=".txt", verbose::Bool=false) -> Dict{String, Int64}

Reads a text file and creates a dictionary from its contents. Each line of the file is treated as a unique key in the dictionary, with all values set to 1. This can be useful for quickly indexing or identifying the presence of words in a text file.

# Arguments
- `filename::String="words.txt"`: The name of the file to be processed. If no file extension is provided, the default extension (`.txt`) is appended.
- `rawDataFolder::String="rawData/"`: The directory path where the file is located.
- `extension::String=".txt"`: The file extension to be appended to `filename` if it's not already present.
- `verbose::Bool=false`: If `true`, prints additional information about the file processing, including extension additions.

# Returns
- `Dict{String, Int64}`: A dictionary where each key is a word from the file, and each value is set to 1.

# Notes
- The function assumes that each line of the file contains a single word. It does not perform any splitting or parsing of lines beyond treating each line as a separate word.
- The dictionary's values are fixed at 1, indicating the presence of words rather than counting their occurrences.
- If `verbose` is `true`, and the filename does not include an extension, a message is printed about appending the default `.txt` extension.

    ackWithMemo(m::Int, n::Int, memo::Dict = Dict()) -> (Int, Dict)

Computes the Ackermann function, a classic example of a highly recursive mathematical function, with added memoization to improve performance by caching the results of previous computations.

# Arguments
- `m::Int`: The first parameter of the Ackermann function. Must be a non-negative integer.
- `n::Int`: The second parameter of the Ackermann function. Must be a non-negative integer.
- `memo::Dict`: (Optional) A dictionary used to memoize results of the Ackermann function to avoid redundant computations. Defaults to an empty dictionary.

# Returns
- `(Int, Dict)`: A tuple containing two elements:
    - The first element is the result of the Ackermann function for the given `m` and `n`.
    - The second element is the updated memoization dictionary containing all computed `(m, n)` pairs up to this point.

# Notes
- The Ackermann function is defined as follows:
    - `A(m, n) = n + 1` if `m = 0`
    - `A(m, n) = A(m - 1, 1)` if `m > 0` and `n = 0`
    - `A(m, n) = A(m - 1, A(m, n - 1))` if `m > 0` and `n > 0`
- Due to the highly recursive nature of the Ackermann function, memoization is used to store the results of function calls with specific `(m, n)` pairs. This significantly reduces the number of recursive calls needed, especially for inputs that would otherwise lead to many repeated calculations.
- This implementation automatically caches results of the Ackermann function in the `memo` dictionary, which can be passed to subsequent calls to further optimize performance.

# Warning
- The Ackermann function grows extremely rapidly. Even with memoization, computing `ackWithMemo` with large `m` and `n` can result in significant memory usage due to the large size of the memoization dictionary.

# Examples
```julia
# Compute the Ackermann function without memoization dictionary provided

This method is highlighted for its efficiency in comparison to an array-based implementation, with the dictionary approach generally providing better performance due to the lower computational complexity of search and insertion operations.

# Arguments
- `arr`: A string or an array of characters to be checked for duplicates.
- `verbose::Bool=false`: If `true`, prints additional information about the process, including notification when a string argument is converted into a vector of characters.

# Returns
- `Bool`: Returns `true` if any duplicate characters are found; otherwise, returns `false`.

# Notes
- The function checks for duplicates by counting character occurrences with a dictionary, which typically allows for O(1) access time on average. This is more efficient than array-based methods, especially for large datasets.
- If the input is a string, it is automatically converted into a vector of characters to ensure uniform processing.
- This approach is significantly faster than the array-based method discussed in Exercise 10-7 of "Think Julia". Benchmarking results using `@btime` show this method to be quicker (e.g., 1 Î¼s vs. 2 ms for a specific string), underlining the efficiency gains from utilizing a dictionary for occurrence tracking.

# Performance Comparison
- Compared to the array-based implementation in Exercise 10-7, this dictionary-based method is notably more efficient for detecting duplicates in strings or character arrays. The efficiency advantage is demonstrated through benchmarking, with `@btime` results indicating faster performance for the dictionary method.

# Example
```julia
julia> hasDuplicatesDict("bananarama")
# Output: true

julia> hasDuplicatesDict("qwertyuipasdfjklzxcvbn")
# Output: false
```

    array2Dict(arr; verbose::Bool=false) -> Dict{String,Int64}

Transforms an array of strings into a dictionary, where each unique string in the array becomes a key, and the value for each key represents the number of times that string appears in the array.

# Arguments
- `arr`: An array of strings to be converted into a dictionary.
- `verbose::Bool=false`: If `true`, prints additional information about the process. Currently, this option does not alter the output but is included for future extensibility.

# Returns
- `Dict{String,Int64}`: A dictionary with keys representing unique strings from the array, and values indicating the frequency of each string.

# Notes
- The function efficiently tallies occurrences of each string, making it useful for counting and frequency analysis tasks.
- The implementation ensures that each string's count is accurately incremented, regardless of its initial absence or presence in the dictionary, using the `get` function with a default value of 0.

# Example
Given an array of strings `["apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "banana", "cherry", "cherry"]`, the function will return a dictionary:
```julia
{
    "apple" => 2,
    "banana" => 2,
    "cherry" => 3
}
```
